#+TITLE: Icecast Exporter

Icecast Exporter exports statistics from Icecast into Prometheus.

We use this at [[https://urn1350.co.uk/][University Radio Nottingham]] for pulling statistics from our web streaming into a Grafana instance which is used to find listener counts in time-series.

** Install

Ensure you have a working Go installation (minimum 1.18) and run the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ go install github.com/jb3/icecast-exporter@latest
#+END_SRC

Once installed, you will find the compiled binary at ~/home/user/go/bin/icecast-exporter~.

** Usage

Once you have a binary, you can use the program with the following command line flags:

| Flag       | Default    | Required | Description                                                     |
|------------+------------+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~url~      | N/A        | ✅       | The URL of the Icecast ~status-json.xsl~ endpoint to poll from. |
| ~port~     | 2112       | ❌       | The port to listen and serve metrics from.                      |
| ~endpoint~ | ~/metrics~ | ❌       | Endpoint to serve metrics from.                                 |
| ~interval~ | ~15~       | ❌       | Timing interval to poll Icecast (seconds).                      |

An example invocation is as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ./icecast-exporter -url https://icecast.example.com/status-json.xsl -port 1234
#+END_SRC

** Running in the background

An example FreeBSD ~rc.d~ service might look like:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
#!/bin/sh

. /etc/rc.subr

name="icecast_exporter"
rcvar="icecast_exporter_enable"
pidfile="/var/run/icecast_exporter.pid"

command="/usr/sbin/daemon"
command_args="-P ${pidfile} -r -t icecast_exporter /home/joe/go/bin/icecast-exporter -url https://icecast.example.com/status-json.xsl"

load_rc_config $name
run_rc_command "$1"
#+END_SRC

Once this file has been edited and placed in `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/icecast-exporter` (and set to executable), run:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# Enable the Icecast Exporter service
$ sysrc icecast_exporter_enable=YES
# Start the Icecast Exporter service
$ service iceast_exporter start
#+END_SRC
